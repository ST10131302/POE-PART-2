We have updated our app that allows users to enter and manage recipes. The application allows users to enter the details for multiple recipes, including the name, ingredients, and steps. It also provides features such as displaying the recipe list, and selecting a recipe to view. The software calculates and displays the total calories of each recipe and notifies the user if the total calories exceed 300.
